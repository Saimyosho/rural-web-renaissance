## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Not Receiving Emails?**

1. Check Supabase Edge Functions logs
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
3. Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set correctly
4. Check spam folder
5. Verify trigger is active: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_contact_submission';`

### **Auto-Reply Not Sending?**

1. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
2. Verify prospect's email is valid
3. Check Edge Function logs for errors

### **Gemini Analysis Failing?**

The system has fallback analysis if Gemini fails:
- Returns sensible defaults
- Logs error for debugging
- Still generates Claude prompts
- Email still sent

### **Need to Update the Prompts?**

Edit the `analyzeWithGemini` function in:
`supabase/functions/send-contact-notification/index.ts`

Then redeploy: `npx supabase functions deploy send-contact-notification`
