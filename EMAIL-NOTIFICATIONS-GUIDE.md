---

## 🔔 OPTION 2: Supabase Dashboard Webhooks (EASIER!)

No code needed! Use Supabase's built-in webhook feature.

### What You Get:
✅ Notifications via Slack, Discord, Email  
✅ No Edge Function deployment  
✅ Point-and-click setup  

### Setup Time: 5 minutes

### Steps:

#### Via Zapier (Recommended):
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Database → Webhooks → Create Webhook
3. Table: contact_submissions
4. Events: INSERT
5. Type: HTTP Request
6. URL: [Zapier webhook URL]

Then in Zapier:
1. Trigger: Webhook by Zapier
2. Action: Send Email (Gmail)
3. Configure email to yourself
```

#### Via Make.com (More powerful):
```
1. Create Make.com scenario
2. Trigger: Webhook
3. Copy webhook URL
4. Add to Supabase webhook
5. Actions: 
   - Send email
   - Add to Google Sheets
   - Send SMS via Twilio
   - Whatever you want!
```

#### Via IFTTT (Simplest):
```
1. Create IFTTT applet
2. If: Webhook received
3. Then: Send email notification
4. Copy webhook URL to Supabase
```

## 📱 OPTION 3: Browser Notifications (INSTANT!)

Get notifications right in your browser while you're working.

### What You Get:
✅ Instant browser notification  
✅ Works on desktop & mobile  
✅ No email clutter  

### Setup Time: 2 minutes

### I can build this for you! Just say:
"Add browser notifications for new contacts"

### How it works:
```typescript
// Subscribe to real-time changes
supabase
  .channel('contact-submissions')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'contact_submissions' },
    (payload) => {
      // Show browser notification
      new Notification('New Contact!', {
        body: `${payload.new.name} just submitted the form!`
      })
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## 📊 OPTION 4: Daily Email Summary (LOW MAINTENANCE)

Get one email per day with all submissions.

### What You Get:
✅ One daily summary email  
✅ All submissions in one place  
✅ Less email noise  

### Setup:
Use Supabase Cron Jobs or Zapier scheduler to send daily summaries.
