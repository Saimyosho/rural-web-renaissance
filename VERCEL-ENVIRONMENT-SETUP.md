## üîç If Still Not Working

### **Check 1: Verify Variables Are Set**

## üìû Quick Checklist

- [ ] Added VITE_SUPABASE_URL to Vercel
- [ ] Added VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY to Vercel
- [ ] Checked all 3 environments for both variables
- [ ] Redeployed from Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Waited 2-3 minutes for build
- [ ] Tested contact form on live site
- [ ] ‚úÖ Contact form works!

---

## üí° Why This Happened

Your `.env` file works locally but isn't pushed to Git (for security).
Vercel needs these same values configured in its dashboard.

**Local:** Reads from `.env` file ‚úÖ
**Production:** Reads from Vercel environment variables ‚ùå (not set yet)

---

## üéØ After Setup

Once this is working, you can also set up the AI lead system by adding these to Supabase Secrets:

1. `RESEND_API_KEY` (from resend.com)
2. `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from Google Cloud)

But first, get the contact form working! üöÄ
